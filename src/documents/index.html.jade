        p Gang Garrison 2 is a free multiplayer 'demake' of Valve's Team Fortress 2. With all 9 classes, many different TF2-inspired environments, and fast-paced, team-based, multiplayer gameplay represented, GG2 is the premier TF2 tribute/parody/alternative.
        p It was originally conceived by mrfredman and MedO for the 2008 TIGSource.com 'Bootleg Demake' competition, with many developers later adding new features.
